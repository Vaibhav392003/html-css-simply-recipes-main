# Building a Recipes Website Using HTML and CSS
Creating a recipes website using only HTML and CSS is a great way to practice front-end web development and build a visually appealing platform for users to explore various recipes. This project involves structuring the website using HTML and enhancing its design using CSS to ensure a user-friendly and visually engaging experience.

Project Overview
The recipes website is a simple, static web page that displays multiple recipes with their descriptions, ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions. The goal is to provide a clean and easy-to-navigate interface where users can quickly find and follow recipes. Since this project is built only using HTML and CSS, it does not include dynamic functionalities like user authentication, comments, or backend storage for recipe data.

HTML Structure
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the fundamental structure of the website. The website consists of multiple sections, including:

Homepage: The homepage contains a welcoming message, a navigation bar, and a featured recipes section showcasing some popular dishes.

Recipe Listings: This section displays a list of recipes, each with an image, title, short description, and a link to view the full recipe.

Recipe Detail Page: Each recipe has a dedicated page that provides detailed information, including ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time.

About and Contact Pages: These pages contain information about the website and provide a contact form for user inquiries.

The HTML code follows a semantic structure, using elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and <div> for organization. The <img> tag is used to display images of dishes, and <ul> or <ol> lists are used to present ingredients and steps in an organized manner.

CSS Styling
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to enhance the visual appearance of the website. It provides styles for layout, colors, fonts, and spacing to create an attractive design. The website follows a responsive design, ensuring it looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Key CSS Features
Navigation Bar Styling: The <nav> element is styled with a background color, padding, and hover effects for links.

Recipe Cards Layout: The recipes are displayed in a grid or flexbox layout, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.

Typography: Different fonts, colors, and text sizes are used for headings, paragraphs, and buttons to improve readability.

Image Styling: Recipe images are made responsive to adjust to different screen sizes.

Hover Effects: Interactive hover effects on buttons and links enhance user engagement.
